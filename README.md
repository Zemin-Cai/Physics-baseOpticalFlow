# Physics-based Optical Flow

This repository contains an open source optical flow program in Matlab for extraction of high-resolution velocity fields from various flow visualization images.   
It is a useful tool for researchers to use the optical flow method in various flow measurements. The principles of the optical flow method are concisely described in references (e.g. Liu 2008), including the physics-based optical flow equation, the variational solution, and errors.   
The central parts include the main program, relevant subroutines and selection of the relevant parameters in optical flow computation. Examples are given to demonstrate the applications of the optical flow method.  

## Requirements
The code has been tested on Matlab2021a.
